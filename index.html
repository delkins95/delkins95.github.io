							<h2>Davidson College Marketing Intern</h2>
							<p>Working for the marketing promotions team at Davidson College allowed me to develop valuable skills, ranging from finding the most effective use of social media, to analyzing trends with season ticket holders. I worked independently and as part of a team to improve the use of social media on Davidson College's campus, which could help induce student attendance at athletic events.
My team and I also conducted analysis to address the issue of lack of attendance at Davidson home basketball games. Using photoshop, I was in charge of creating flyers to distribute to each elementary school in the Mecklenburg and Cabarrus County area, which advertised a specific game during the season that allowed students of the respective elementary schools to attend the game for free.</p>

							<h2>College of Wooster Play-by-Play Commentator</h2>
							<p>As the play-by-play commentator for the College of Wooster Women’s Basketball games, I was able to give a running commentary of the games featured on the website’s livestream. Working along side other Wooster students, I was able to gain experience in both color commentary and play-by-play. This enabled me to become a more articulate, and confident public speaker. In relation to calling the women's basketball games, I also had the opportunity to collaborate with two friends on their Woo91 radio show. The show centered around sports, as I was able to gain familiarity with radio technology.</p>

							<h2>Independent Study</h2>
							<p>Throughout my Senior year at the College of Wooster, I have taken what I have learned in and out of the classroom, and applied it to a yearlong independent project. As a student-athlete at the College of Wooster, I have always had a passion for collegiate athletics and its role following graduation. Using basic Economic theory, I have developed the hypothesis that student-athletes have greater productivity than non-student-athletes, leading to greater success in the workforce. After surveying over 600 former College of Wooster alumni, I was able to use econometric analysis to support my hypothesis, with findings showing that despite spending less hours studying, student-athletes did in fact have a higher starting salary than non-student-athletes.  </p>
